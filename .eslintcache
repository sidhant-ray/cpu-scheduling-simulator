central processing units that execute all arithmetic & logic operations that are available in the main memory.\n In the past, our operating systems were not able to deal with several processes at a time (only one process was taken into the memory). Nowadays most operating systems allow us to execute several processes concurrently. These systems are called multi-programming systems. In these systems, a Process Scheduler (also called Long Term Scheduler) chooses a process to be taken into the memory to be run from the secondary memory (hard disk, SSD, etc.). Ready processes are usually kept in queues (CPU ready queue & I/O device ready queue). This multi-programming approach has brought about some issues to be considered. In order to avoid making CPU is idle when an input/output device operation is needed during the execution of a process, CPU Schedulers have been started to be used in order to choose another process among available processes. A CPU scheduler decides the next process according to what algorithm it uses.\n Likewise, I/O devices also use some algorithms to determine which process should be the next process. In this chapter, we are going to go over some most commonly used CPU Scheduling Algorithms.\n</p>\n<br></br>\n<div style={{ width: \"100%\", display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\"}}>\n<img src={\"/sch1.png\"}  /> \n</div>\n\n\n<br></br>\n\n       <ol>\n  <li><h5>First Come First Serve</h5></li>\n  <li><h5>Shortest Job First</h5></li>\n  <li><h5>Priority Scheduling</h5></li>\n  <li><h5>Round Robin</h5></li>\n  \n</ol>\n\n      \n \n        \n\n<Divider ></Divider>\n       \n      </Jumbotron>\n      \n      <Jumbotron>\n     \n      <h2 className=\"display-6\">FCFS</h2>\n      <p className=\"lead\">\n      FCFS algorithm works in a quite straightforward way.
